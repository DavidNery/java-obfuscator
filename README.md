This is a very simple project. I did it during a live.

I didn't worry about a beautiful design or something user friendly, just the typescript / javascript code and the main functionality of the app, which is obfuscating .jar files

## Prints

##### After

# What does it do?
For now, it only obfuscate inner method variables. I think about expanding it and making it more robust.
